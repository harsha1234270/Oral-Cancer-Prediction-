# Oral-Cancer-Prediction-
This project aims to develop a hybridized neural network model integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for the accurate prediction and classification of oral cancer. 
By leveraging the spatial feature extraction capabilities of CNNs and the sequential pattern recognition strengths of RNNs, the model enhances the early detection and treatment outcomes for oral cancer, ultimately improving patient care.

Features

Hybrid Model: Combines CNNs for spatial feature extraction and RNNs for sequential pattern analysis to predict oral cancer from histopathological images.

EfficientNet Backbone: Utilizes EfficientNet as a pre-trained base model for feature extraction, followed by additional layers for robust prediction.

Real-Time Prediction: Capable of real-time prediction with a user-friendly interface for medical professionals.

Data Management: Securely stores patient data, including medical images, in a database with efficient retrieval and management capabilities.
